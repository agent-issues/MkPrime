# MkPrime (development version)

* New `kPrimePrior = "empirical_geometric"` prior (now the default).  Decomposes
  `k' = N_obs + N_unobs`, with `N_obs` drawn from an empirical pmf tabulated
  from real morphological matrices (`empiricalNObs`) and `N_unobs` from a
  `Geometric(p)` with `Beta(a, b)` hyperprior on `p`.  The convolution of the
  two distributions defines the prior on `k'` and counters the previous
  tendency of inference to collapse the number of unobserved states to zero.
* New `MkPrimeEmpiricalPrior()` constructor and `empiricalNObs` package
  dataset, allowing users to override the empirical component.
* `gibbs_p` Gibbs draw on `p` is disabled under `"empirical_geometric"`
  (no Beta conjugacy under the convolution); replaced with a Metropolis-Hastings
  step `mh_p` reusing the existing scale move infrastructure.
