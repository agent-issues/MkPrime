# MkPrime (development version)

* New `kPrimePrior = "empirical_geometric"` prior (now the default).  Decomposes
  `k' = N_obs + N_unobs`, with `N_obs` drawn from an empirical pmf tabulated
  from real morphological matrices (`empiricalNObs`) and `N_unobs` from a
  `Geometric(p)` with `Beta(a, b)` hyperprior on `p`.  The convolution of the
  two distributions defines the prior on `k'` and counters the previous
  tendency of inference to collapse the number of unobserved states to zero.
* New `MkPrimeEmpiricalPrior()` constructor and `empiricalNObs` package
  dataset, allowing users to override the empirical component.
* `gibbs_p` Gibbs draw on `p` is disabled under `"empirical_geometric"`
  (no Beta conjugacy under the convolution); replaced with a logit-scale
  Metropolis-Hastings move `mh_logit_p` (move type 30).  The multiplicative
  `mh_p` move (type 8) is rejected for most proposals when the posterior on
  `p` concentrates near 1 (typical under the empirical_geometric prior),
  causing the adaptive scheduler to crush its weight to the floor and `p`
  to stay stuck; proposing on the unbounded logit scale fixes this.
